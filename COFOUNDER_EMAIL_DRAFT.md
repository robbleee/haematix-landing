Subject: Strategic Partnership Opportunity - Love Hope Strength Foundation

Hi team,

Quick update on a strategic partnership opportunity that's come up:

**Love Hope Strength Foundation** (a charity focused on cancer care in lower/middle-income countries) is interested in funding haem.io projects for LMEs. Since they're a charity and can't fund for-profit entities, I've proposed creating a **Haem.io Global Access Initiative** with them as Founding Partner.

The idea:
- Establish a charitable arm/CIC under haem.io for LME-focused work
- Love Hope Strength provides initial funding (50-100k GBP range)
- They get permanent recognition as Founding Partner
- We use the funds to deploy haem.io in LME countries (they have hospital connections in Dar es Salaam, and Luke's Cambodia experience aligns perfectly)

**Key benefit:** Because this would be a charitable initiative, the BSH may be able to give their money directly to us in this case (rather than requiring a separate charitable entity structure).

I've set up a data room for them at `/global-access-initiative` - happy to walk through the proposal if helpful.

Thoughts?

Robert
