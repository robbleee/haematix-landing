## Option 1: Standard (Best for InMail)
*Context: Professional, comprehensive, establishes full context.*

Hi Edward,

I recently read your *Blood Advances* paper on discordant MDS diagnoses. Your finding that **21% of cases are misdiagnosed** (even after fixing coding errors) highlights a critical gap in standardization.

We are tackling this exact problem at **Haem.io**. We have built an automated diagnostic system for MDS/AML that uses **formal logic engines** (not black-box AI) to apply WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 guidelines directly to extracted pathology data.

We are currently working with **The Christie NHS Foundation Trust** and have established a partnership with the **UK AML Research Network** to validate the system, with plans to expand to all myeloid disorders.

Given your work on diagnostic discordance, I would value your perspective on our approach. Would you be open to a brief chat?

Best,

## Option 2: Concise (Best for Messaging)
*Context: Punchy, respects time, higher response rate.*

Hi Edward,

I read your paper on the 21% misdiagnosis rate in MDS—a stark reminder of the need for standardization.

I'm building **Haem.io**, a system that automates MDS/AML diagnosis using formal logic engines based on WHO/ICC guidelines to eliminate some of this variability. We are currently validating this approach with **The Christie NHS Foundation Trust** and the **UK AML Research Network**.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether this approach could mitigate the discordance issues you identified. Open to a quick chat?

Best,

## Option 3: Connection Request (< 300 Characters)
*Context: If you are sending a connection request without InMail credits.*

Hi Edward, read your paper on MDS misdiagnosis rates (21%). We're building Haem.io to solve this using WHO/ICC logic engines to automate diagnosis. Validating with The Christie & UK AML Research Network. Would value your thoughts on our approach to reducing discordance.

## Option 4: Targeted & Natural (Focus on "Miscoding" Findings)
*Context: Conversational tone. Focuses on the specific "coding error" problem which your software solves best.*

Hi Edward,

I just finished reading your Blood Advances paper on MDS misdiagnosis. The 21% discordance rate is huge, but what really stood out to me was that over half (53%) of the local errors were just "site miscoding" rather than subjective interpretation differences.

That's actually exactly what we're trying to solve at Haem.io. We've built a system that uses formal logic engines (instead of just black-box AI) to strictly apply the complex WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 rules to the data. Ideally, this would cut out those miscoding errors entirely.

We're currently validating this with The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and the UK AML Research Network.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether this kind of automated logic could have prevented some of the discordance you found. Open to a quick chat?

Best,
