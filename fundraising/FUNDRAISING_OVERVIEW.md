## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

From UK_VC_OUTREACH_PLAN.md:

❌ **Waiting for perfect materials** → Ship at 80%, iterate  
❌ **Only one VC at a time** → Maintain 10-15 parallel conversations  
❌ **Generic outreach** → Personalize every single email  
❌ **No follow-up** → 50% of opportunities need a reminder  
❌ **Too available** → Create healthy scarcity  
❌ **Stopping traction** → Keep signing NHS pilots while fundraising  

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Week 1-2
✅ **Block dedicated time** - 3-4 hours/day, no distractions  
✅ **Get co-founder buy-in** - Divide and conquer research  
✅ **Start with warm intros** - Higher success rate  
✅ **Practice pitch early** - Don't wait until first meeting  

### For Week 3+
✅ **Follow up same day** - Reply within 4 hours to investors  
✅ **Update tracker religiously** - After every interaction  
✅ **Score meetings** - Use scoring system to improve  
✅ **Share wins** - Post NHS milestones on LinkedIn  

### For Week 11+
✅ **Don't celebrate early** - Term sheet ≠ closed deal  
✅ **Get startup lawyer** - SeedLegals, Taylor Wessing  
✅ **Compare term sheets** - Not just valuation, but value-add  
✅ **Keep backup options** - Don't rely on one VC
