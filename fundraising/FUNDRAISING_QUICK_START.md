## 📞 Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

Practice this until you can deliver it smoothly:

> "I'm Robert, CEO of Haem.io. We've built AI-powered diagnostic software for blood cancers that takes diagnosis time from days or weeks down to 2 minutes.
> 
> The problem: Haematologists spend hours manually extracting genetic data from reports before they can even begin diagnosis. And modern guidelines are so complex—hundreds of pathways—that consistent application is nearly impossible.
> 
> Our solution combines AI extraction with formal logic engines to deliver WHO and ICC compliant classification instantly. We're not replacing clinicians—we're giving them an AI-powered assistant that handles the complexity.
> 
> We're currently piloting with Manchester Foundation Trust and The Christie NHS, and we've been included in a £7 million national AML research study. Our founding team includes two practicing NHS haematologists plus tech founders.
> 
> We're raising £750k seed to reach UKCA certification and first NHS sales. We start with blood cancers—1.2 million cases per year globally—and expand to all cancers as we scale.
> 
> Would love to show you a quick demo."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Waiting for "perfect" materials** 
   - Ship at 80% quality, iterate based on feedback
   
2. **Only talking to one VC at a time**
   - Always have 5-10 active conversations
   
3. **Not tracking your outreach**
   - Use the tracker from day 1
   
4. **Being too available**
   - Don't reschedule your whole life for one VC meeting
   - Create healthy scarcity
   
5. **Giving up after no response**
   - 50% of emails get no response
   - Follow up once after 7-10 days
   
6. **Stopping traction while fundraising**
   - The best fundraising position is not needing money
   - Keep signing pilots, publishing results

## 🆘 If You're Stuck After 2 Weeks

### No responses to outreach?
- **Check:** Is your email going to spam? Test with a friend
- **Try:** More warm intros, fewer cold emails
- **Review:** Is your subject line compelling?
- **Consider:** Your LinkedIn profile might need updating

### Can't find warm intro paths?
- **Expand:** Ask co-founders to map their networks
- **Try:** NHS colleagues who've worked with startups before
- **Consider:** Fractional fundraising advisor (5% fee)
- **Alternative:** Apply to accelerators (Seedcamp, Entrepreneur First)

### Getting meetings but no follow-up?
- **Evaluate:** Score your last 3 meetings (use scoring system)
- **Ask:** Request honest feedback from friendly VC
- **Review:** Record yourself pitching, watch back
- **Consider:** Pivot messaging based on objections
