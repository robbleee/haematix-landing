## 🎓 Fundraising Best Practices

### The Golden Rules

1. **Always be building** - Keep hitting NHS milestones while fundraising
2. **Warm intros >> Cold emails** - 4x the time getting warm intros
3. **Parallel conversations** - Always have 10-15 active VC conversations
4. **Same-day follow-ups** - Reply within 4 hours to every investor email
5. **Track everything** - Use VC_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md religiously
6. **Practice, practice, practice** - 10+ pitch run-throughs before first meeting

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Waiting for "perfect" materials (ship at 80%)  
❌ Only talking to one VC at a time (parallel pipeline)  
❌ Not following up (50% need a reminder)  
❌ Being too available (create healthy scarcity)  
❌ Stopping traction during fundraise (keep building)  
❌ Taking "no" personally (it's usually timing/fit)

## 💡 Pro Tips from the Trenches

### Week 1-2: Preparation
- **Tip:** Don't wait for perfect materials. Ship your deck at 80% quality.
- **Common blocker:** Analysis paralysis on which VCs to contact
- **Solution:** Just pick the top 5 from UK_VC_OUTREACH_PLAN.md and start

### Week 3-6: Outreach
- **Tip:** Personalize every single email. Generic = ignored.
- **Common blocker:** Can't find warm intros
- **Solution:** Ask co-founders, NHS colleagues, portfolio company founders

### Week 7-10: Meetings
- **Tip:** Listen more than you talk. Take notes. Ask smart questions.
- **Common blocker:** Not getting second meetings
- **Solution:** Use scoring system (VC_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md) to improve

### Week 11-16: Closing
- **Tip:** Don't celebrate the term sheet. Deal's not done until money's in bank.
- **Common blocker:** Legal process taking forever
- **Solution:** Get startup-specialist lawyer (SeedLegals, Taylor Wessing)

## 💪 Final Motivation

Fundraising is hard. You'll get way more "no's" than "yes's". You'll have weeks where nothing seems to be working. This is normal. Every successful founder has been exactly where you are.

**Three things to remember:**

1. **You only need 1-2 "yes's"** - You're not trying to convince everyone, just find the right partners
2. **Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"** - You're learning and improving with each conversation
3. **The business matters more than the fundraise** - Keep hitting NHS milestones. Traction solves everything.

**The right investors will see what you're building. Now go find them.**

## 📞 Questions?

If you're stuck on something specific:
- **Co-founders**: Discuss in weekly sync
- **Clinical advisors**: Leverage NHS contacts for warm intros
- **Community**: Post in TechNation, HealthTech UK Slack groups
- **Professional help**: Consider fractional CFO or fundraising advisor (5% fee)

**Now stop reading and start executing. Day 1 begins now.** 🚀
