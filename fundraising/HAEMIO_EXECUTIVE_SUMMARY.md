## 🎯 The Opportunity

**Seeking:** £750,000 seed investment  
**Valuation:** £3-4M pre-money  
**Use of Funds:** 18-month runway to UKCA certification and first NHS sales  
**Target Close:** Q1 2026

## 🩸 The Problem

Blood cancer diagnosis is facing a crisis:

- **Data Chaos**: Haematologists manually extract critical genetic markers from multiple unstructured reports (cytogenetics, flow cytometry, molecular data) before diagnosis can even begin
- **Overwhelming Complexity**: Modern WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 guidelines contain hundreds of interconnected diagnostic pathways—too complex for consistent human application
- **Life-or-Death Delays**: Current diagnosis takes days to weeks. Blood cancer cells can double in 24 hours. Every delay is potentially fatal.

> *"Accurate diagnosis forms the absolute bedrock of effective therapy"*  
> — Dr. John Chadwick, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust

Smaller NHS trusts lack specialist expertise and must outsource to 5 specialist centers at great cost and delay.

## 💡 Our Solution

Haem.io is the **only end-to-end AI diagnostic system** for blood cancers:

1. **AI Extraction**: Advanced LLMs extract structured data from any report format (PDFs, scanned docs, text files)
2. **Logic Engine**: Formal decision trees based on WHO 2022 and ICC 2022 guidelines deliver precise classification
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI extracts what it can, logic engines run diagnostic pathways, and we ask clinicians for additional information only when needed—minimal input, maximum accuracy
4. **Complete Diagnostic Pipeline**: Not just diagnosis—we deliver treatment recommendations, clinical trial matching, risk stratification (ELN, IPSS), and follow-up planning

**Time to diagnosis:** ~2 minutes (vs. days/weeks)

### Why We're Different

| Traditional Approach | Pure AI Solutions | Haem.io |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Manual data extraction | Black box decisions | AI + formal logic |
| Hours of clinician time | No explainability | Transparent reasoning |
| Error-prone | Inconsistent | Validated pathways |
| Days to diagnosis | Can't be certified | Medical device certified |

**Zero integration friction:** Works with existing hospital systems—no IT integration required.

### Appendix: Key Questions Answered

**Q: Why can't hospitals just use ChatGPT?**  
A: Three reasons: (1) Regulatory—generic LLMs can't be certified as medical devices, (2) Liability—no explainability or audit trail, (3) Accuracy—we've tested this; generic LLMs fail on complex diagnostic pathways.

**Q: What if big tech builds this?**  
A: Three defensible moats: (1) Clinical expertise—our haematologist co-founders encode years of specialist knowledge, (2) NHS relationships—we're building trust within NHS networks, (3) Speed to market—by the time big tech enters, we'll have contracts and regulatory approvals.

**Q: How do you compete with SOPHiA GENETICS?**  
A: Different problem. SOPHiA does genomic sequencing analysis (upstream). We do end-to-end diagnosis + treatment matching (downstream). Potentially complementary.

**Q: Why start with blood cancers?**  
A: Strategic choice: (1) Highest complexity—if we solve this, all other cancers become easier, (2) Team expertise—our clinical co-founders are haematologists, (3) Market validation—pilot trusts are already desperate for this solution, (4) Speed to value—blood cancer patients can't wait for diagnosis.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**  
A: Regulatory delays. UKCA could take longer than planned. We've mitigated this by engaging notified body early, budgeting conservatively (£100k), and hiring a compliance officer. Our 24% contingency buffer provides additional runway if needed.
