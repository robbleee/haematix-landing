### Template 2: Cold Email to VC (use sparingly, only when no warm intro possible)

**Subject**: Haem.io - NHS-validated AI for blood cancer diagnosis [£750k seed]

---

Hi [Partner Name],

I'm Robert Lee, CEO of Haem.io. We've built an AI diagnostic system for blood cancers that's currently being validated by NHS trusts and included in a £7M national research study.

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
[Personalized 1-2 sentences based on their portfolio/thesis - e.g., "I saw your investment in [Portfolio Company] and your thesis on clinical decision support AI resonated with what we're building."]

## V. Frequently Asked Questions (Prep for Investor Meetings)

### Product & Technology
1. **Q: How accurate is your AI extraction?**
   A: We achieve [X%] accuracy on genetic marker extraction in our validation studies. Importantly, our human-in-the-loop approach means we ask clinicians to verify or provide missing information, ensuring diagnostic accuracy is never compromised.

2. **Q: What happens when your AI gets it wrong?**
   A: Our system never makes autonomous diagnostic decisions. The logic engine flags uncertain cases and prompts clinician review. We're building a clinical decision support tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment.

3. **Q: How do you handle different report formats across hospitals?**
   A: Our AI is trained on diverse report formats from multiple NHS trusts. The system uses flexible parsing rather than rigid templates. We've validated this with reports from [X] different hospitals.

4. **Q: What about data privacy and security?**
   A: Built for NHS compliance from day one: end-to-end encryption, UK data residency, GDPR compliant, pseudonymization. We're architecting for ISO 27001 and Cyber Essentials Plus certification.

### Market & Competition

5. **Q: What if a big tech company (Google, Microsoft) builds this?**
   A: Three reasons we're defensible:
   - **Clinical expertise as moat**: Our haematologist co-founders encode complex diagnostic logic that takes years of domain expertise to replicate
   - **NHS relationships**: We're building trust and validation within NHS networks
   - **Speed to market**: By the time big tech enters, we'll have NHS contracts and regulatory approvals

6. **Q: How do you compete with SOPHiA GENETICS, PathAI, etc.?**
   A: They're solving different problems:
   - SOPHiA: Genomic sequencing analysis (upstream)
   - PathAI: Solid tumor histology (different domain)
   - We're the only end-to-end system for blood cancer diagnosis under 2022 guidelines

7. **Q: Why wouldn't hospitals just use ChatGPT/Claude?**
   A: Three reasons:
   - **Regulatory**: Generic LLMs can't be used for medical diagnosis (no CE/UKCA marking)
   - **Liability**: No explainability, no audit trail, no medical device accountability
   - **Accuracy**: We've tested this - generic LLMs fail on complex diagnostic pathways

### Business Model & Growth

8. **Q: Why would NHS trusts pay £50-100k/year for this?**
   A: ROI is clear:
   - **Efficiency**: Saves [X] hours per diagnosis × [Y] cases per year = [Z] FTE equivalent
   - **Accuracy**: Reduces diagnostic errors (hard to quantify but extremely valuable)
   - **Access**: Smaller trusts can provide specialist-level diagnosis without outsourcing to 5 big centers (currently costs £[X] per case)

9. **Q: What's your CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?**
   A: NHS sales cycle: 6-12 months, requires:
   - Clinical demonstrations (2-3)
   - Pilot study (3-6 months)
   - Procurement process (3-6 months)
   
   Estimated CAC: £15-25k per trust (sales effort + pilot costs)
   LTV: £50k × 5 years = £250k minimum → 10:1 LTV:CAC ratio

10. **Q: How do you scale beyond the UK?**
    A: WHO/ICC guidelines are global standards. Our system works anywhere these are used:
    - **Phase 1**: UK NHS (proving ground)
    - **Phase 2**: EU (CE marking), GCC countries (private hospitals), Malaysia (strong UK medical training ties)
    - **Phase 3**: US (FDA clearance) - larger market but later entry

### Regulatory & Risk

11. **Q: What's your path to UKCA certification?**
    A: We're classified as Class IIb medical device (diagnostic software with AI):
    - **Q1 2026**: Engage notified body, submit technical file
    - **Q2-Q3 2026**: Clinical evaluation, performance studies
    - **Q4 2026**: UKCA audit and certification
    - **Budget**: £100k allocated

12. **Q: What if regulatory requirements change?**
    A: We're tracking:
    - EU AI Act (high-risk AI system requirements)
    - UK AI White Paper developments
    - MHRA software as medical device guidance
    
    Our compliance officer (to be hired) will ensure we stay ahead of regulation.

13. **Q: What are your biggest risks?**
    A: Three main risks:
    - **Regulatory delays**: UKCA could take longer than expected (mitigated: early notified body engagement, expert consultants)
    - **NHS adoption speed**: Pilot success doesn't guarantee procurement (mitigated: multiple pilots, strong clinical champions)
    - **Technical validation**: Edge cases may require more refinement (mitigated: human-in-the-loop design, ongoing clinical input)

### Team & Fundraising

14. **Q: What happens if one of your haematologist co-founders leaves?**
    A: Both Drs. Burthem and Carter-Brzezinski are deeply committed (equity incentivized). We're also building relationships with 5+ additional NHS haematologists as clinical advisors to reduce key person risk.

15. **Q: Why £750k? Why not more/less?**
    A: Precisely scoped to key milestones:
    - **Core team**: 3 FTE for 18 months
    - **UKCA certification**: £100k
    - **4 NHS pilots**: £80k
    - **Infrastructure**: £70k
    - **Contingency**: £150k (24% buffer)
    
    Less would be undercapitalized for regulatory + pilots. More would dilute unnecessarily before proving model.

16. **Q: What's your target valuation?**
    A: We're targeting £3-4M pre-money, which would give investors 18-25% equity for £750k. This is in line with UK seed-stage health tech valuations in 2025/26, and reflects:
    - NHS traction (3 pilots + £7M grant inclusion)
    - Exceptional team (clinical + technical co-founders)
    - Clear path to revenue (Q4 2027)
    - De-risked technology (working prototype)

## IX. Key Mantras for Fundraising

1. **"No" doesn't mean never**: 80% of investment opportunities require 2-3 touches over 6-12 months

2. **Always be building**: The best fundraising position is to not need the money urgently. Keep hitting milestones.

3. **Investors invest in momentum**: Each NHS pilot signed, each endorsement received, each press mention = social proof

4. **Warm intros > Cold emails**: Spend 4x the time getting warm intros vs. cold outreach

5. **You're interviewing them too**: Fundraising is a two-way evaluation. Choose investors who add strategic value.

6. **Narrative matters**: You're not selling software - you're offering a stake in transforming blood cancer diagnosis globally.

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Fundraising will be emotionally challenging - expect many "no's" before you get to "yes." Stay focused on:

1. **Building the business**: Milestones matter more than pitch perfection
2. **Finding the right partner**: Not all money is equal
3. **Maintaining momentum**: Keep pipeline full, don't rely on any single VC

You have a genuinely exciting opportunity here: 
- **Strong team** (clinical + technical)
- **Real traction** (NHS pilots, grant inclusion)  
- **Massive market** (blood cancer → all cancers)
- **Clear path** (UKCA → sales → Series A)

The right investors will see this. Now go find them.

**Good luck!**
