    bio: [
      "Robert is the architect of Haem.io's core technology and leads the company's strategy. His mission is deeply personal, born from his experience as a Burkitt's Lymphoma survivor diagnosed at 19, which instilled in him the critical importance of rapid, accurate diagnostics.",
      "After graduating from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Computer Science, Robert worked in FinTech at the London Stock Exchange Group and FlexTrade, specialising in building and testing high-frequency algorithmic trading platforms. He applied the rigour of this environment to healthcare, developing a novel hybrid AI framework that combines AI-driven data extraction with a deterministic logic engine.",
      "He brought this concept to Dr. John Burthem, and together with Dr. Luke Carter-Brzezinski, they co-developed the platform. As the sole author of the core codebase, Robert leads all technical development and fundraising efforts, driven by his personal commitment to improving the diagnostic journey for cancer patients."

      "Following his PhD, Dr. Clarke joined the UK Civil Service as a statistician, where he applied AI and data science to support high-frequency government decision-making. He has extensive experience in building scalable, production-ready solutions on cloud platforms to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.",
      "A long-time friend of Robert, he was a key early contributor to the development of Haem.io's LLM and data extraction strategy, bringing a first-principles approach to building secure and robust systems."
