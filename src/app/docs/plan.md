## Investor Pitch Strategy

### Seed Round Pitch Framework (Months 6-8) - POST-LOI POSITION

**Opening Hook**:
"We have 3-5 signed LOIs from NHS trusts, validated through alpha testing, with haematologist co-founders who have demonstrated strong community support. We need execution capital to deliver on these committed pilot sites."

**Key Pitch Elements**:
1. **Validated Commercial Demand**: 3-5 signed LOIs from NHS trusts post-alpha testing
2. **Proven Clinical Adoption**: MDS Working Group demonstration and strong community support
3. **De-risked Technology**: Alpha testing validates clinical utility and workflow integration
4. **Established Market Access**: Haematologist co-founders with demonstrated NHS credibility
5. **Clear Revenue Pathway**: Committed pilot sites with validated pricing discussions

**Financial Projections** (STRONGER):
- Year 1: 3-5 pilot sites generating £200k-500k revenue
- Year 2: 10-15 NHS trusts, £750k-1.5M revenue  
- Year 3: 25+ NHS trusts, £2M-4M revenue
- International expansion with proven NHS case studies

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Addressing Investor Concerns**:

1. **NHS Administrative Timeline Risk**: 
   - "LOIs can take 6+ months in NHS - how do you guarantee hitting targets?"
   - **Answer**: "Pilot-in-a-Box" pre-vetted packets make it easy for R&D departments to say yes
   - 10-15 trust pipeline to achieve 3-5 LOIs (33% conversion realistic)
   - Extended 9-12 month pre-seed runway provides significant buffer for delays

2. **Hospital Resource Burden Risk**: 
   - "Who does the work of anonymizing 1000 patient records?"
   - **Answer**: Clinical Affairs team works on-site under trust supervision
   - We provide the manpower, drastically reducing resource burden on trust
   - Flexible cohort sizes (50-100 initial, 500-1000 stretch goal)

3. **LOI vs Revenue Valuation Gap**: 
   - "LOIs aren't commercial contracts - how do you justify the valuation?"
   - **Answer**: Market access de-risking premium - we've solved the biggest HealthTech hurdle
   - Each LOI represents £200k-500k annual contract potential
   - Investment is for execution on pre-sold demand, not market exploration

4. **Single Event Dependency Risk**: 
   - "Too much weight on MDS Working Group demonstration"
   - **Answer**: Parallel direct outreach to 10-15 trusts independent of MDS group
   - MDS demo is catalyst, not sole source of LOIs

5. **Regulatory Approval Timeline Risk**: 
   - **Answer**: Logic-based system reduces AI regulation complexity
   - HRA/REC submission in Phase 1, approval expected in Phase 2
   - Regulatory pathway clarified through advisory board
