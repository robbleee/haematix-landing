- **Code Location**: `utils/security_config.py` - `SecurityValidator.validate_https_connection()`

```python
# Automatic HTTPS validation
if not SecurityValidator.validate_https_connection():
    st.error("🔒 HTTPS Required: This application handles sensitive medical data")
    st.stop()
```

#### Session Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration

```python
# Example sanitization
def sanitize_medical_report(report_text: str) -> str:
    # Remove script injections
    sanitized = re.sub(r'<script[^>]*>.*?</script>', '', report_text)
    # Remove SQL injection patterns
    sql_patterns = [r'union\s+select', r'drop\s+table', ...]
    for pattern in sql_patterns:
        sanitized = re.sub(pattern, '', sanitized, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return sanitized.strip()
```

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade PII Detection and Anonymization**

    def anonymize_medical_text(self, text: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Dict]]:
        """Advanced medical text anonymization with audit trail"""
        # Analyze for PII using advanced NLP
        analyzer_results = self.analyzer.analyze(
            text=text, entities=self.medical_entities, language='en'
        )
        
        # Custom medical anonymization
        operators = {
            "PERSON": OperatorConfig("replace", {"new_value": "[PATIENT]"}),
            "PHONE_NUMBER": OperatorConfig("replace", {"new_value": "[PHONE]"}),

            "US_SSN": OperatorConfig("replace", {"new_value": "[SSN]"}),
            # ... additional operators for medical context
        }
        
        return self.anonymizer.anonymize(text=text, 
                                       analyzer_results=analyzer_results, 
                                       operators=operators)
```

#### Data Residency and Control
- **❌ Data Location**: No guaranteed US-only data processing (⬇️ reduced risk - no stored data)
- **✅ Encryption at Rest**: **NOT APPLICABLE** - No data stored at rest
- **❌ Network Isolation**: Shared infrastructure without healthcare isolation (⬇️ reduced risk)

### 2. **Technical Safeguards (Significantly Enhanced)**

#### ✅ **Implemented**
- **Access Control**: Multi-layer authentication with role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring of all PHI access and processing
